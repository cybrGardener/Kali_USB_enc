# Kali_USB_enc
Simple, coarse bash script to get Kali USB with encrypted persistence.

Okay, I will now need to work on that and upgrade it.

Reminder to myself what I want to do, so I don't forget:
1. script parts to automatically detect iso images + usb devices
2. random password generation
3. menu to choose options
4. optimize some commands f.e. dd, parted
5. make hardened iso in the future (?)
6. add that grouped .deb file with extra packages for ISO
7. go to sleep
